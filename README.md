# FacetReactClientDeploy

A minimal Express web server for serving [FactReactClient](https://github.com/cblakeley/FacetReactClient).

## Raison d'Ãªtre
FacetReactClient uses client-side routing in the form of React Router. Serving FacetReactClient from a static file server will usually fail. For example, if you used React Router with a route for /facet/, the webpack development server will respond to localhost:8000/facet/ properly, but an Express server serving a production build will not.

## Current Test Server

<http://osdb.openlinksw.com:4433/facet/>

## Notes

The base path from which FacetReactClient is served is set in `FacetReactClient/src/index.js`, through the `basename` property, i.e. `<BrowserRouter basename="/facet">`. The `baseUrl` property in `FacetReactClientDeploy/frcd/config.js` must match this `basename`.
